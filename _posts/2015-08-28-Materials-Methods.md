### Idea/Question:

*S. pombe* cells do not round up when starved or low-pH-adjusted. Concern of reviewers: Is the cell wall really gone/ completely digested? Calcofluor white staining of cell wall could answer this question.


### Protocol:

	- Inoculated strain in EMM5 complete 1% glu
	- Incubation o/n at 30˚C
	- Diluted and regrown to OD~0.5
	- Harvested 8 ml, then continued as described in i. - III.

#### I. Control 1: with wall

	- Resuspended in 200 μl EMM5
	- Cell wall stain with calcufluor. Icubated cells (200 µl) with 10 µl calcofluor solution for 10 min in EMM5 medium. Washed out calcofluor with medium twice.

#### II. Control 2: without wall, round

	- Resuspended in 200 μl spheroplasting buffer (PC buffer pH 6.0, 1.1 M sorbitol, cell wall digesting enzymes: Trichoderma mix 1.25 mg/ml, Zymolyase 0.25 mg/ml)
	- Incubate @ 30˚C + shaking for 2 hours
	- Cell wall stain with calcufluor. Icubate cells (200 µl) with 10 µl calcofluor solution for 10 min. Washed out calcofluor with spheroplasting buffer.

#### III. Spheroplasting of starved cells:

	- Resuspended in EMM5 medium w/o glucose containing 20 mM 2DG + 10  µM Antimycin A
	- Incubate for 2 hours
	- Transfer to spheroplasting buffer (PC buffer pH 6.0, 1.1 M sorbitol, cell wall digesting enzymes: Trichoderma mix 1.25 mg/ml, Zymolyase 0.25 mg/ml) containing 20mM 2-DG, 10  µM Antimyciffn A.
	- Incubate at 30˚C for 2 hours
	- Calcufluor staining as for control
	- Image at DV_home


### Results?

	- Are there many rods without cell wall @ energy depletion and low pH conditions? If yes, cells keep their shape independent of cell-wall...
